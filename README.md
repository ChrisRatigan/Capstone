# Data-Science-Projects
This repo contains some of my most recent data science projects.

CNNProject was my Capstone for General Assembly's Data Science Immmersive course where I built a spider to scrape articles from CNN and classify them by author based on their text. I have ommitted the raw data I scraped for its size and the code for the spider for security reasons (e.g. DDOS attacks).

Reddit Classification Project was an early project using the reddit API to classify posts as either from Technically the Truth or Dadjokes. Since the content of most Technically the Truth posts were memes, this required using Optical Character Recognition to get the posts into a usable format.

Finally, the Group Project on Presidential Debates was a General Assembly Project with JJ Reyes and Lara Fares where we webscraped the text of presidential debates, parsed and cleaned them, and then classified them by author. The full project can be found in my colleague's repo https://github.com/zonikjj/DSIR907-Project4-Group1. As noted in my blog post on Linkedin, my contributions were in scraping and cleaning the data.
