# Data-Science-Projects
This folder repo contains some of my most recent data science projects. Including scraping articles from CNN and classifying them by author, scraping and cleaning presidential debate transcripts for a group project where we classified them by speaker, and classifying reddit posts as coming from either Dadjokes or Technically the Truth.
